### Introduction

I have recently been reading *Neural Computing: An Introduction* (R Beale and T Jackson), an old but very clearly written description of the basic principles of the field. It is, however, very light on mathematics. I decided that a fun way to round out my knowledge would be to build a very simple perceptron, completely from scratch.

### Method

As with most large projects, I figure a sensible way to proceed is to build something simple and then slowly add complexity.  So, we shall begin by creating a single neuron and implementing
